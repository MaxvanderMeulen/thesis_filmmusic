# Video Did Not Kill The Radiostar

The changing way in which consumers discover music, especially with the use of technology, has an impact on music popularity. In this thesis, we study the influence of a song being featured in a TV series on its music popularity. Using a unique long-format dataset in which weekly song data serves as the unit of analysis, we estimate the treatment effect with a difference in differences analysis. The results suggest that featuring a song in a TV series can have a negative effect on its music popularity, although the model used in this study may not accurately represent the relationship. Further research is needed to fully understand the influence of a song being featured in a TV series on its music popularity, as well as the potential drivers of this effect.
